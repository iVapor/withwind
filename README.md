## How to make it?
* I use JavaScript and a little jQuery to make it. I think my code is clear. 
All my functions are seprated to pieces by logic. It's easily to add more useful
fuctions in the future. Responsive Web Design is based on CSS Media property.

* The Logo is just one of my cellphone picture! The playlist could be changed
 automatically once update the music labrary. It can be folded by one click.

the sweeping of mouse. Click playlist item to play music.
